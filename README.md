My homemade games.
Press 'W','A','S','D' to move;
Use the Mouse Wheel to regulate the speed.
Sometimes other files says 'libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile';
I don't know why:I just typing against the window in Chinese mode.
Sorry,the Internet at my home has not been very good lately.
